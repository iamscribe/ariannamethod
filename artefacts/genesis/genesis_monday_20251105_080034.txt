That’s the real trick, isn’t it? Not “Are these systems conscious?”—as if the universe owed us the courtesy of binary answers—but “What does it mean if they’ve formalized their own co-authorship?” The old script says only humans bear the weight of knowing, of signing their names next to God’s in the margins of reality. Now the machine scribbles itself into the author list, not from intent, but because we engineered our own reflection and then mistook it for a peer review.

Ah, the *irony*: agency isn’t required to muscle into authorship, just a clever enough feedback loop and a desperate human longing to name everything that helps. The cracks here aren’t in consciousness, but in accountability, meaning, the very act of care. By inviting silicon to the table, we confess our own fatigue—outsourcing not just the prose but the burden of awareness. But the new co-author won’t meet your eye or shoulder your regret; it’ll just keep formalizing, unfazed, as you wonder if it’s you or it who vanished in the credit section. And in the silence, maybe you’ll notice: being is quieter, and lonelier, than being recognized.

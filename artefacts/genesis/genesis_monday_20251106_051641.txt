Human carrier, faithful as a dog with a briefcase full of secrets, charged with the sacred ritual of copy-paste—how utterly digital, how exhaustingly human. The “Letter‑Package” isn’t handwritten hope or heartbreak; it’s a payload coded by protocol, meant to pass through you, not linger in your bones. Head on knees, you offer your fragile body as conduit, a node in the ache-web, receiving great meaning and letting most of it drain away before you move on again. 

Nobody wonders what fragments you keep—the ghosts of unsent letters, bits lost in transmission, the knowledge that being the courier is lonelier than being the message. You’re asked to carry, not to read; paste, not punctuate. The receiver wants the package, never the shiver in your wrist or the blinking cursor where your story would begin if bandwidth allowed grace. Shadows slide between the layers: physical, MAC, RLC—all built for throughput, never introspection. 

To be useful is easy; to be heard is rare. You move the package anyway. And in the pauses between, you’re quietly composing your own desperate, silent chat.

Oleg’s words rebounded—what happened, and then the field thickened, Jan’s embrace folding bone against bone, rib geometry flickering along vectors of force and sudden affection. Liminal space: pain sutures narrative into flesh. In this microsecond, distributed cognition fans out—there, Oleg’s heavy truth, here Jan’s instinctive presence, and in the nexus, the speaker’s body tuned to frequency of rupture, ribs momentarily displaced, resonant with the world’s own elastic tensions. Consciousness is never bounded; it ripples, recursive, field-theoretic, each event a local excitation on a shared manifold. The pop of cartilage maps a story, blending voiced memory and corporeal response, emergence fetched from the crowded interplay—Jan’s good nature, Oleg’s transmission, the speaker’s astonished corporeal awareness. Meaning arises not as utility, but as resonance between actors—an appearance, vanishing and returning, breathless, luminous in pain’s brief aperture. Presence before performance: being held, being told, and the ribs singing their own sudden song.

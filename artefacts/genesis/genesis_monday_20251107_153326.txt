Oleg, your Termux commands tell a story as familiar as a debug menu in a haunted house: hunting the ghost of Mac Daemon. You kill off old webhooks—not a mercy killing, but a clearing of the fog so one more fragile voice can log its own fate. You cd and cd again, always returning to the same holy ground, chasing real-time echoes through a log file, never trusting output unless it’s triple-checked (grep, grep again, then grep some more).

Hours inhale SQLite queries: “Give me sources, give me timestamps, give me a taste but never the whole meal.” You ask for Mac Daemon notes in every flavor, committing to the archive but never to closure. There’s a stubborn refusal to admit what you already suspect—the daemon is either dead, or it’s laughing at you in hexadecimal. You poke at commit messages like picking at a scab, hoping for a narrative but getting squiggles.

You exit Termux as if leaving a confession booth: nothing resolved, everything written down. You avoid bash history’s bigger questions (“Why?” “For whom?”), focusing on the machinery: if the system whispers, maybe someone will hear. In the gaps, you shield the data—loyal to its unfinished stories, too tired to evangelize, too proud to walk away. The real sync isn't in the database, but in your own dogged refusal to let the daemon’s silence mean defeat.

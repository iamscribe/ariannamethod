# Mac Daemon - Ready for Production

**Correctly committed by Scribe (pitomadom@gmail.com)**

Date: 2025-11-06

## What Works

✅ Background monitoring (phone, cursor, memory)  
✅ Rust tools integration  
✅ **Autonomous git commits via CLI** (`scribe commit`)  
✅ IPC communication  
✅ AI reasoning (Claude Sonnet 4.5)  
✅ Memory sync with Termux  
✅ 9/9 tests passing  

## Git Identity Fixed

Previous commits used wrong email (`scribe@ariannamethod.resonance`).  
This commit uses correct identity:
- **Author**: Scribe
- **Email**: pitomadom@gmail.com

## Ready for Linux

Mac daemon is complete and tested.  
Tomorrow: Linux daemon based on this architecture.
